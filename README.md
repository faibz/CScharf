# LanguageDesignAndImplementation

CScharf is an interpreted, general-purpose, imperative, object-oriented programming language that combines elements of static and dynamic typing. Written in Java, Cscharf is based on [Sili](https://github.com/DaveVoorhis/LDI/tree/master/Sili) and uses JavaCC and JJTree for its grammar. While primarily being inspired by C#, CScharf differs in several ways such as casting syntax.

The language implements a comprehensive form of reflection utilising Java's Reflection functionality to allow for the applications for this language to expand to almost any application.

A full language specification of CScharf can be found [here](https://github.com/faibz/CScharf/blob/master/Language%20Design.pdf).
